The one where Tobias looks at people of colour in medieval times

If you look at medieval everyday life, the question "what did people look like?" comes up occasionally. When I was young, that was an interesting topic you could debate among friends. But in 2020, this is of course loaded with identity politics ((I was tempted to borrow the phrase "loaded to the gills", but that might be appropriating a culture I do not belong to, and whether identifying as fish would be enough is a different question, as we are still debating whether identifying as a seven year old girl allows me to go to the elemental school bathroom for girls.))

You see, something that just should just merit some interest amoung historically interested people now tends to escalate very quickly. The development and release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance was one of those occasions. KCD have been accused of not having blonde girls.
