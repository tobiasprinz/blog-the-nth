They will be coming for you... a blueprint

First things: The gun community is big on closing its ears and not wanting to hear inconvenient things. The standard mode is deciding the unpleasant voice they are hearing is of an opponent. Because that invalidates everything, right? But I am sorry, dear web-affine average American gun owner: I got more guns than you, more ammo, more training hours logged - and none of that through any kind of government job, all paid as a private citizen. And I am not advertising myself for some government contracts - all training I have provided has always been free. Computer Science pays so much more than gun stuff.

First, understand that the second amendment is the greatest thing to exist when it comes to guns. Making the ownership of guns a right, not a priviledge, was the best move. As a German, I've had to subsist on priviledge. Ironically my privileges have allowed me to have more suppressors and more SBRs than you, average american gun owner.

First: It is not just my suppressors and SBRs than can be taken away easily. Since yours also have a tax stamp attached, there is a paper trail. And yeah, there is the gun trust thing. But while those have a legal

I should clarify here: I might call myself "German" these days, but when I was born, we were "Western Germans". Because there were also Eastern Germans (Virginians might take note of how to properly label your states). So next door we got this social experiment of how far you can push surveillance.

So, let's give it a whirl:

First, remember that I love that 2nd amendment? I also understand that it is a piece of paper. And if you are honest, it is a badly written one, compared to the others. The debate about the well regulated militia is obviously not clear. While the most recent interpretation has been in your favour, Antonin Scalia is no more. He was also an idiot regarding other issues and that will taint later evaluations of his opinions.

This is not the first time I've posted this. One of my favourite reactions was "you idiot, stop giving them ideas!". To which I never took the time to craft an appropriate response. Here it is: Thank you for valuing my intelligence so much higher than that of a whole government agency with decades to think about it..
