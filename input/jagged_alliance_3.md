I believe every reviewer carries a bias, so let's be upfront: I love the Jagged Alliance series. I was hooked when the demo of JA1 came out, I decided it was true love when I blew up that infected tree on Metavira on JA1 (fans know why that is special, everyone else ignore it), I made more than 50 scenarios for 1.5 and I played JA2 v1.13 every year for ten years. And it has also influenced my second career as shooting teacher and my occasional work in "challenging environments". So, yeah, this one is close to my heart.

So, how does JA3 stack up to, as you might guess, a ton of expectations? 
Great!
It works well as a game, as a story and as a successor to a game already more a myth than a game.


# JA as a game
If you do not know the JA series or only the bad parts (and it got crappy 20 years ago, so...), what do you get? A great tactical game.

You get to figure out a world and its mechanisms - not just how to deal with enemies, but also the intricacies of logistics, finances and merc relations. A bunch of things are done via hidden counters and triggers, which are great fun to discover.

You get neat pacing that gives you time to experience the game and get good at playing it: This may annoy fans of the famous JA2 v1.13, but acquiring better guns is spread over time by tier-based drops, as are gun modifications, which depend parts that are also controlled by tier-dependent item drops. Ammo issues are also a good trick to keep you from becoming overpowered too quickly (yes, a HK21 LMG with armor-piercing ammo on overwatch is as much fun as you can have with your pants on, but it is sooo expensive to run), as is the flow of money that pays for your mercs. Which means you can play this nice, comfortable and slow or figure out the mechanisms and speed everything up.

The unique skills of the mercs are all interesting and tempt you do try different builds. Although some can be exploited better than others, none feels total OP: Even Ivan (3AP back for a kill) with the short-barreled Auto-5 (3AP per shot) and the get-free-move-back-for-shotgun-kills and the more-free-move-for-light-armor perks is still balanced by the short range of the gun, the stupid ushanka he insists on wearing instead of a helmet (Comrade, Altyn helmet is stylish, too!) and the hassle to get him started.

Still, once you get into grove (there are several successful strategies) and kit your team accordingly, it becomes a bit samey - as did JA2, by the way. But for one, figuring things out and "getting it" (or, as other writers call it, "achieving mastery") is part of the fun of the JA series. Also, as the saying goes, war is boring except for short moments of sphincter-clenching panic - and you get those moments, too: They put a nice twist in the middle of the game, which hopefully hits you unprepared (it beats the Drassen attack of JA2 fame, which came way too early) and if you ever managed to finally afford, say, Gus or Magic, only to have them dropped in a port that got occupied a few hours ago while being terribly under-equipped, you'll get enough moments of panic for a lifetime.

There are also tons of interesting sub-plots, from obvious to funny to cheesy (I like the totally-not-a-zombie red rabies patients, they fit the genre better than the crepitus of JA2). So if the tactics and the strategic ressource management don't get you, the action-movie plots will.

As for replayability: There are some plays incentivized by achievements, there are some that are just you challenging yourself (like playing with that really useless merc or gun that you love anyway) and a lot can be done with alredy existing mods.


# JA3 for fans of the series
I am sure there was a faction of hardcore JA fans who wanted the obsessive detail level of JA2 v1.13 with the "tons of guns" switch. JA3 does not have that. And I am quite fond of that fact. Yes, the Dragunov, the AK-74, AKSU and AK47 use the same ammo instead of three different ones. The Desert Eagle uses .50BMG, a cartridge that in reality is roughly as long the whole gun. Yes, you cannot put a suppressor on Minimi or HK21, but on the RPK - even though in reality, doing the former is much easier than the latter. But from a game perspective, it is all for the better: As said, the available ammo paces the game and the mutually exclusive features make decisions matter (for aforementioned HMGs, only the RPK can be suppressed for usa as a nice first-round surprise tool, the Minimi shoots nicely from the hip and works with a light/medium armored skirmisher, while the HK21 simply kills everything that moves - if you put it down and have it face correctly).

Still, the old tons-of-guns will come. Because of mod support. There are already some mods for that. There's gotta be a good one at one point.

Some old plays don't work. JA2 was easy to beat with night vision specialists, nvg goggles and chosing your time of attack (made even easier with the heli). This does not work anymore. I say: Great!

The custom settings mod has a bunch of features of JA2 v1.13 for different types of games: Enemies dropping all items, but coming in squads twice the size? Hell yeah!

Basically, for us old fans, the only thing Haemimont had to get right was propper mod support - and they did!


From both perspectives I'd say this is great stuff. Well done, Haemimont. Now build the Metavira- and Arulco-Campaigns as DLC, please! Maybe throw in the DG campaign for free or to demo the modding capabilities.


Note: I received this specific steam key as a gift, because a friend works for THQNordic and knows how much I love the Jagged Alliance series, but knew I was a bit jaded after all the crap that came between JA2 and this. Still, I bought the boxed version for my collection, so I do not consider it a free product.
