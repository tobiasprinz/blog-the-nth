# Kingdom Come: Deliverance
Also lovingly called "the Henry simulator" among fans (and there are a lot, this is pretty close to a cult classic), you play Henry, the blacksmith's son, in the little town of Skalitz in Bohemia in the year 1403. Some might call it "Elder Scrolls in a medieval setting", but that would be describing the engine and that part matters the least. It is not a half-assed high-priced skin to sell an Elder-Scroll-like game. No, this is probably the most realistic game ever set in a medieval period. If you've spent as much time as I have on all things reenactment & reconstruction or larped and wondered if there was ever a way to make a straight medieval setting actually interesting and engaging, this where to look.

## What to love: Story and characters


## What to learn: Bugs and features

## What to chance: Making this work for the aged dad with two kids
The main decision is whether you want to mod the saving system. Via default, you only save voluntarily when sleeping and drinking a certain potion. The game also saves when starting a new quest (except in hardcore). This is quite, erm, medieval. It did not have to be, as shown by the fact how easy this can be modded away. But the pacing of the game becomes different if you can save: Medieval Bohemia is a dangerous place. Even as a well equipped knight, you will die if ganged up upon by some half-competent soldiers. Dieing means reloading meaning losing progress. So you become more careful, more polite and, for the average gamer, a lot less an anti-social killing machine. That's laudable case of a gaming mechanism emphasizing setting-appropriate gameplay. But it also means you can lose hours when you accidentally keep pressing X after dismounting your horse, because you just sicced your dog on that very important NPC.

## First encounters of the woke kind
But first: How did I find this gem? Via controversity. Famously, KCD, as it is abbreviated ((which makes me wonder: isn't it tempting to make some kind of overhaul mod and call it XKCD?)) had its 15 minutes of fame when the game was criticized for not having any black characters in it. The lead designer gruffly countered hat there weren't any, because there weren't any in Bohemia in 1403 within the reach of the story (there might have been some black courtier/ambassador/slave in Prague). That, of course, was not enough for the outrage crowd but it probably helped the awareness. Larry Correia would have a field day with this story

At one point I assumed this was manufactured for just the purpose of driving sales, especially since the developer was not fired. Caving in to feld public pressure is customary in such situation for an American company. But the latter part could also be explained by the dev team being Czech, and I at least from my Czech shooting contacts I always got that they appreciate both gruffness in men and little tolerance of stupidity to a degree that most westerners find off-putting. In addition to that, observations on social sites show me that people actually can be this stupid about this game and have continued to do so since the game's release in 2018.
